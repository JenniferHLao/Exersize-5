This code uses the turtle library in python to create balloons of different colors.  

After importing the turtle library global variables are created that defined the unique color codes for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and brown. These global string variables are used to feed the pen object within the turtle library to change the colors of the flowers as needed. The first function created  is the my ballon function which takes  a turtle object, an x and y co-ordinate, and a radius to create a ballon. The primary role of this function is to create balloons from the point that the origin point of the turtle when the function is called. The next function is the main procedure that runs the whole program. This function sets up a turtle object and iterates through a while loop that verifies if the user wants to draw balloons, validates the user response, enters into two internal while loops that define the number and color of the balloons, jumps into an if else statement to define colors, sets balloon placement variables, and finally draws the balloons.    

The goal of this project was to practice using the turtle module, and to utilize loops and conditional statements.
